        While making my advertisement, I had the goal of clearly stating what I was advertising in mind. The critique process shaped my revisions by influencing me to raise the volume of the sound effects so they can be heard more clearly.

        Critique Notes
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Alex- color for the slogan could stand to be different so that it looks nicer</li>
        <li>John- add bold outline to text so that they can be seen more clearly</li>
    </ul>
